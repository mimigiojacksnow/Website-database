# Website-database
A blog website I made in the past. It uses php, html, css, and mysql. Most of front end was used with bootstrap. It's quite old and fairly outdated. Will be updated soon 

# How to use
Download Xampp using the link below 
https://www.apachefriends.org/

After you install it, open it, and start apache and mysql. Once both have started, open the admin page for Mysql and import the Blog_database.sql folder into it 
Once you have done so, you are able to begin creating accounts, blogs, and so forth.

When creating the admin account, all you have to do is set leve id for admin to 1 through the admin page using XAMPP.
