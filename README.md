# Website-database
A blog website I made in the past. It uses php, html, css, and mysql. Most of front end was used with bootstrap. It's quite old and fairly outdated. Will be updated soon 

# How to use
Download Xampp using the link below 
https://www.apachefriends.org/
and follow the steps to download XAMPP

After you install it, open it, and start apache and mysql.

Once both have started, open the admin page for Mysql and find the import tag near the top of the screen.

Once found, click on it and import the Blog_database.sql file. 

Once you have done so, you are able to begin creating accounts, blogs, and so forth.

When creating the admin account, click on the user table and select desire user you wish to become admin. Once you have found your user, click on edit and set their level to 1. All other accounts that are made do not need any further editing through the localhost page if you wish for them to be normal users.

DO NOTE: This blogging website does not have email capabilities or anything of the sort.
